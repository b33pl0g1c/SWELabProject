## Motor Part Shop Software
This is a project made by group 18 for [Software Engineering Laboratory (CS3074)](https://website.nitrkl.ac.in/Academics/AcademicDepartments/SyllabiDetails.aspx?d=Q1M6Q29tcHV0ZXIgU2NpZW5jZSBhbmQgRW5naW5lZXJpbmc=-MBb7wMG/NVo=&di=OA==-GS5YNjRcEt0=&c=Q29tcHV0ZXIgU2NpZW5jZSBhbmQgRW5naW5lZXJpbmcgKEIuVGVjaC4gLSA0eXJzKQ==-0cT/CxL+Srw=&t=VUc=-/CGGPdtU1IU=&s=Njg4Mw%3d%3d-MOdU7dvGBPY%3d).


### Problem Statement:
The motor parts shop deals with large number of motor parts of various manufacturers and
various vehicle types. Some of the motor parts are very small and some are of reasonably
large size. The shop owner maintains different parts in wall mounted and numbered racks.
The shop owner maintains as few inventory for each item as reasonable, to reduce inventory
overheads after being inspired by the just-in-time (JIT) philosophy. Thus, one important
problem the shop owner faces is to be able to order items as soon as the number of items in
the inventory reduces below a threshold value. The shop owner wants to maintain parts to
be able to sustain selling for about one week. To calculate the threshold value for each item,
the software must be able to calculate the average number of parts sales for one week for
each part. At the end of each day, the shop owner would request the computer to generate
the items to be ordered. The computer should print out the part number, the amount required
and the address of the vendor supplying the part. The computer should also generate the
revenue for each day and at the end of the month, the computer should generate a graph
showing the sales for each day of the month.
